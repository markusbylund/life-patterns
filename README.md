# Life Patterns

A personal data project that visualizes daily habits and behavioral patterns to support self-awareness and better decision-making.

## Overview

Life Patterns is a project designed to collect, structure, and visualize daily activities to uncover patterns in behavior over time.  
The goal is to explore how structured data and simple visualizations can provide insights into routines, productivity, and well-being.

This project reflects an interest in system thinking, data-driven decisions, and user-centered design.
